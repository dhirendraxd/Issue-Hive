# IssueHive

IssueHive helps campus communities surface problems, rally support, and track fixes together.

## What you can do
- Raise new issues with clear titles and descriptions.
- Upvote and comment to add context and priority.
- Follow profiles and view followers/following.
- Send and receive messages from profile pages.
- See progress as issues move toward resolution.

## How it works (timeline)
1. Report an issue — share the problem and why it matters.
2. Gather support — upvotes and comments signal priority.
3. Track to resolution — watch status and updates until it’s done.

## Profiles & avatars
- Choose from default avatars. Custom image uploads are disabled.
- Add a short bio, location, and social links.

## Highlights
- Clean About page with a simple vertical timeline.
- Humorous 404 page for lost explorers.
- Mobile-friendly layout and navigation.
- Safe external links and sanitized social URLs.
- Fair play: you can’t vote on or like your own content.

## Quick start (non-technical)
- Sign in, set up your profile, and raise your first issue.
- Browse issues, upvote the ones you care about, and join the discussion.

— No capes. Just clean timelines and community fixes.
